# Ignoring files in Git

There are 3 file statuses in git, untacked, tracked (modified, unmodified, staged), ignored. When we create new files, they become untracked automatically.But we can infore file by using .gitignore file, in that file we can comment by using #.

`git rm cached <file name>` to ignore previously commited file.

There are some templates to get .gitignore file. Resources are gitignore.io, /github/gitignore repo. We can get .gitignore for our desired language.
