git clone <link of Github repo> -clone and create folder which contain all files in github repo 

please note that when we download repo from github, we don't get 
git files(in hidden git folder) of remote repo

discard changes in vs code means , change file to previous version(previous version in last commit)


git commit -m <message> -a (this means changes firstly will be added to staged area)
When we have new pages, it is not working, it works with only modified files
