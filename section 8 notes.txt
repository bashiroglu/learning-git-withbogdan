we have 2 kinda merging 1. fast-forward merge 2. 3 ways merge

in every merge we need to 
1. create new branch 
2. change files and commit changes
3. checkout main branch 
4. command merge process by -git merge feture-branchName 

Please remember that Git itself will decide which way to use depends on whether you have
new commits in you branch or not

1. fast-forward merge: this is possible when we don't have new commits 
after creating new branch in master branch. And in this case, we are supposed to be
in master(HEAD> Master) we simply change master and Head to last commit of new Branch

2.
